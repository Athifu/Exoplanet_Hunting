# Exoplanet Hunting via the Transit Method


Vist Our Webpage : https://github.com/Athifu/Exoplanet_Hunting.git

**A Submission for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**

## Abstract

This project is a web-based educational tool designed to introduce the public to the transit method of exoplanet detection. Developed by a team of friends for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025, this minimalist and visually engaging website explains how astronomers find planets orbiting other stars by measuring the dip in starlight as a planet transits its star.

## Key Features

*   **Engaging Visuals**: The site uses a space-themed aesthetic with animated celestial bodies to create an immersive learning environment.
*   **Clear Explanations**: The core concepts of the transit method are explained in simple, easy-to-understand language.
*   **Interactive AI Component**: The project features a conceptual AI model designed to calculate a "raw transit value," demonstrating how technology aids in analyzing stellar data to identify exoplanet characteristics.
*   **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean, single-page design ensures that the focus remains on the educational content.

## Project Structure

The application is organized into a few key files:

*   `index.html`: The main landing page containing the project's core information.
*   `login.html` & `dashboard.html`: These files provide the user interface for interacting with the AI transit value calculator.
*   `assets/`: This directory holds the project's stylesheets (`styles.css`) and JavaScript files (`main.js`).

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1.  Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3.  Explore the content and click the **"Calculate your raw transit value"** button to proceed to the interactive portion of the site.

## Technology Stack

This project was built using fundamental web technologies:

*   **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the webpage.
*   **CSS3**: For styling, layout, and animations.

## The Team

This project was a collaborative effort by a passionate team of friends. We are proud to have contributed to the spirit of innovation and public engagement celebrated by the NASA Space Apps Challenge.
