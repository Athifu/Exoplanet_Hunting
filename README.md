# Transit Method Exoplanet Project

Vist Our Webpage : https://athifu.github.io/Exoplanet_Hunting/
## NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025

This project was developed by me and my friends for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025. It is a simple, minimal webpage designed to explain and demonstrate the transit method for detecting exoplanets.

## Overview

This project showcases the **transit method**, a technique used to discover exoplanets by observing the dimming of a star's light as a planet passes in front of it. Our goal was to create an accessible and visually appealing webpage that introduces this concept to a wide audience.

The webpage features a simple, space-themed design with animated planets to create an engaging user experience. The core of the project is an AI model (explained on the site) that is trained to calculate the "raw transit value" from the dip in a star's brightness, which helps in identifying the characteristics of an exoplanet.

## Features

-   **Minimalist Design**: A clean and focused design that is easy to navigate.
-   **Space-Themed Aesthetics**: A radial gradient background and animated planets create an immersive, cosmic atmosphere.
-   **Informative Content**: Clearly explains the transit method and the role of our AI model in exoplanet detection.
-   **Interactive Button**: A call-to-action button that directs users to a login page to "Calculate your raw transit value."

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

-   `index.html`: The main landing page of the project.
-   `login.html`: A page for users to log in and access the AI calculation tool.
-   `dashboard.html`: The dashboard where users can interact with the AI model.
-   `assets/`: A directory containing the CSS and JavaScript files for the project.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone or download the repository.**
2.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser** to view the main page.
3.  **Click the "Calculate your raw transit value" button** to navigate to the login page.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5**
-   **CSS3**

This project was a collaborative effort, and we are proud to have participated in the NASA Space Apps Challenge.
